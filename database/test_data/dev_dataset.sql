157	Here’s how to live: Balance everything.	All bad things in life come from extremes. Too much of this. Too little of that. When we lack balance, we’re upset. Over-worked, under-loved, over-eating, under-sleeping. Focused on wealth, but ignoring health. Focused on the present, but...	https://sive.rs/htl27	2021-12-27 00:00:00	f	1	3
158	Here’s how to live: Make change.	Change the world as much as you can. All your learning and thinking is wasted if you don’t take action. People try to explain the world, but the real point is to change the world. If you go through life without changing anything, what have you...	https://sive.rs/htl26	2021-12-26 00:00:00	f	1	3
159	Here’s how to live: Make a million mistakes.	You learn best from your mistakes. This is true. So you should deliberately make as many mistakes as possible.

160	Here’s how to live: Don’t die.	There’s only one law of nature: if you survive, you win. Be paranoid. Avoid failure to survive. For something to succeed, everything needs to go right. For something to fail, only one thing needs to go wrong. Don’t try to be more right. Just...	https://sive.rs/htl24	2021-12-24 00:00:00	f	1	3
161	Here’s how to live: Create.	The most valuable real estate in the world is the graveyard. There lie millions of half-written books, ideas never launched, and talents never developed.

162	Here’s how to live: Love.	Not love, the feeling, but love the active verb. It’s not something that happens to you. It’s something you do. You choose to love something or someone. You can love anything or anyone you decide to love. Love is a combination of attention,...	https://sive.rs/htl22	2021-12-22 00:00:00	f	1	3
163	Here’s how to live: Reinvent yourself regularly.	People say everything is connected. They’re wrong. Everything is disconnected. There is no line between moments in time. Something happened. Something else happened. People love stories, so they connect two events, calling them cause and...	https://sive.rs/htl21	2021-12-21 00:00:00	f	1	3
164	Here’s how to live: Get rich.	Suspend judgment. Making money isn’t evil, greedy, shallow, or vain. Money isn’t your worth as a human being, or a substitute for love.

173	Here’s how to live: Do whatever you want now.	The past? That’s what we call our memories. The future? That’s what we call our imagination. Neither exists outside of your mind.

Difficult conversations save your relationships. But if you avoid pain, you avoid improvement. Avoid...	https://sive.rs/htl10	2021-12-10 00:00:00	f	1	3
175	Here’s how to live: Let randomness rule.	We think we see patterns and causes. Really there are none. We think events are meaningful. Really they’re just coincidence. We’re not used to the logic of probability. Life is more random than it seems. Identical twins were separated at...	https://sive.rs/htl09	2021-12-09 00:00:00	f	1	3
176	Here’s how to live: Master something.	Be a monomaniac on a mission to be truly great at something difficult. Pick one thing and spend the rest of your life getting deeper into it.

177	Here’s how to live: Make memories.	You recently had a day, or even a month, that you can’t remember. If I asked what you did then, you couldn’t say. There was nothing unusual about it.

In 1790, Benjamin Franklin gifted £2000 to the cities of Philadelphia and Boston by putting it into a 200-year trust, and by 1990 it was worth over $7 million.

180	Here’s how to live: Do nothing.	The ten commandments said what not to do. Most of being a good person is not doing bad. Don’t be cruel or selfish. Don’t lie or steal. Just do no harm. People always think they need to do something. One action creates a problem, fixed by...	https://sive.rs/htl04	2021-12-04 00:00:00	f	1	3
181	Here’s how to live: Fill your senses.	See it all. Touch it all. Hear it all. Taste it all. Do it all. Appreciate this wonderful physical world.

182	Here’s how to live: Commit.	If you’ve ever been confused or distracted, with too many options… If you don’t finish what you start… If you’re not with a person you love… … then you’ve felt the problem. The problem is a lack of commitment. You’ve been looking for the best...	https://sive.rs/htl02	2021-12-02 00:00:00	f	1	3
183	Here’s how to live: Be independent.	All misery comes from dependency. If you weren’t dependent on income, people, or technology, you would be truly free.

184	Considerate book pricing	I love having my own store so I can make things the way I think they should be. For example, I disagree with the usual pricing of books.

185	How many pets do you have?	I used to have too many pets. Each time I adopted one, I was fully in love. I was enamored with the potential. Each new pet was meant to be my constant companion.

187	Time is personal. Your year changes when your life changes.	A new day begins when I wake up, not at midnight. Midnight means nothing to me. It’s not a turning point. Nothing changes at that moment. A new year begins when there’s a memorable change in my life. Not January 1st. Nothing changes on January...	https://sive.rs/mny	2019-12-30 00:00:00	f	1	3
188	Experiments in music and life	One approach to music is to do whatever you want. Absolutely anything goes. But to me, that’s too free. It’s anti-inspiring because having infinite options is overwhelming. Another approach to music is to follow tradition. You stay within the...	https://sive.rs/eml	2019-11-07 00:00:00	f	1	3
189	Writing daily, but posting when ready	I just finished an experiment. Last month, I published a new article to my blog every day. I’m glad I tried it, but ultimately I didn’t like it. Here’s why: It made my writing worse, not better. I was trying to force a conclusion quicker. I was...	https://sive.rs/nod	2019-11-01 00:00:00	f	1	3
190	How I got rich on the other hand	I don’t usually talk about money, but a friend asked me what it was like to get rich, and he wanted to know specifics, so I told him my story.

204	Daydreaming is my favorite pastime	Somewhere in our past, we were told it’s bad to daydream, because it meant doing nothing — staring out the window — instead of doing what we’re supposed to be doing.
